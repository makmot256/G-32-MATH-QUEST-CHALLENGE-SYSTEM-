"If a challenge is to consist of 10 questions, 100 questions should be uploaded such that for each
attempt, the 10 questions are selected randomly from the 100 questions."
- Should challenge have questions stored in an array or have a reference to them through foreign key(is sorted out)

"At the close of the challenge, a report of answers for all attempted questions
are sent to all participants and the first two winners are recognized on the website. Each participant is
automatically sent an email providing them a PDF report of the report of right answers."
- should be triggered immediately the user clicks exit

"To reject or activate an applicant, the representative enters a menu item confirm
yes/no username. If one is rejected, they are deleted from the file and moved into a database table rejected
while those that are accepted are deleted from the file and inserted into the participant table in the database.
An email notification is sent for all cases. If one tries to register again under the same school after being
rejected, they are informed on the command line interface and denied from registering under the school."
-necessitating an applicants table then moving confirmed into the participants table


    // query the many-to-many relationship between challenge and question pivot table and use it to display the questions in each challenge (done)
    // checking rejected_applicants table when student tries to register(done)
    // add details/description of each challenge
    // record every attempt per question and stop attempts after the maximum of 3
    //  The questions will be presented one by one and each time a question is presented, the number of remaining questions and time are indicated above the question
    // we need to implement a timer
    // wrong answer = -3 marks , not sure = 0 marks , correct answer = marks originally assigned(necessitate a marks column on each question)
    // can use a pivot table to track attempts(participant_attempts)
    //  When the time for attempting the question expires, the participant challenge is closed and the participant is given their score and report.
    // generate report for each participant on close and esepcialy when duration closes. can put it in a dunction that shows scores,time taken for each question and total time for the whole challenge
